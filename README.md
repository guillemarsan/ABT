# ABT

_Abstract_ :

Many real-world problems are encoded into SAT instances and efﬁciently solved by CDCL (Conﬂict-Driven Clause Learning) SAT solvers. However, some scenarios require distributed problem solving approaches. Privacy is often the main reason. This motivates the need to solve distributed SAT problems. We analyze how this problem can be tacked in an efﬁcient way, and present ABTSAT, a new version of the ABT (Asynchronous Backtracking) algorithm adapted to solve distributed SAT instances. It combines ABT execution with calls to CDCL SAT solvers and clause learning. ABTSAT is sound and complete, properties inherited from ABT, and solves local problems efﬁciently by using CDCL SAT solvers. Experiments on two planning benchmarks show the practical feasibility of the proposed approach.
